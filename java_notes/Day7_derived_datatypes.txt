						 =========================
						 class Test{
							 public static void main(String args[]){
							   
							int i =20;
							short s= 100;
							byte b1= 127;
							byte b2 = -128;
							byte b3  = 200;
							//Test.java:8: error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from int to byte
							//byte b3  = 200;
								//	   ^
								
							double d1 = 20.45;
							float f1 = 5.5;
							/*
								Test.java:15: error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to float
								float f1 = 5.5;
								
								for float datatype we can't assign decimal values directly, why bzc decimal values 
								are by default consider as a double values. 
								so if we want to give values for float type we should use 'f' char after the decimal number.
								
								like 
								
								float f1 = 5.5f;

							*/
							int i = 100000;
							byte b= 100;
							byte b2 = 07;
							int k = 06;
							int l = 08;// here we will get CTE, in java if we use zero in front of any number it will 
							           // consider as octal number. in case octal number will available only 0 to 7, there
									   is no 8 and 9 values in octal.

					2.Derived Data Type: any data types which are created by user him
					self for his convinent requiments those data types are called as 
					derived data types or user defind data types. 
				    or the data types which are created by user is called derived data types or user data types. 
					
					example is : all java classes are user defined data types. it means 
					we can use every class name as a data type for some of the variable or attribtes. 
					those data types are called as derived data types.
					or
					Any java class we can use it as derived data types.
					
					Syntax: 
					ClassName refVar; // only declarationtion, no initialization 
					ClassName refVar = null; // declaration and initialization
					ClassName refVar = new ClassName(); // declaration and initialization
					
					ClassName refVar; // declaration
					refVar = new ClassName();// initialization
					refVar = null; // re initialization
					
					class Person{
					  
					}
					
					Person p1 = new Person();
					
					here p1 is a variable or ref variable or attribute 
					Person is a data type for that p1 variable. 
					
					new Person() : it is value for that derived  person data types attairbutes.


					ex2:
					class A{
					}
					A a1 = new A();// same class object 
					A a1 = null; // null value 
					
					class Car{
					}
					Car c1 = null;
					Car c2 = new Car();
					
					
					
                    possible values for derived data types:
					=========================================					
					for derived data types only 3 types values possible 
					1. null : null means nothing it will consider as no value
					    Perosn p1 = null;
					2. corresponding class object : it measn assinging same class objects into same class variable types 
						Person p1 = new Person();
					3. corresponding child/ sub class objects 
							Parent ref = new Child(); -> correct possible
							Child ref = new Parent(): -> not possible
							
					in this 3 values null is the defualt value for derived data types.
