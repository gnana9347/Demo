Recursive and cyclic : 
======================

method Recursive: the process of calling self invocation or self calling from same method.

 Example is :

 class A{
 
    void m1(){
	   m1(); 
	}
	p.s.v.m(){
	  A a1 = new  A();
	  a1.m1();
	}
 } 
 
 note: method recursive cause the Exception in thread "main" java.lang.StackOverflowError
        at A.m1(A.java:4)
        at A.m1(A.java:4)
        at A.m1(A.java:4)
        at A.m1(A.java:4)
		
 
 example: adding n number of values by using method recursive: 
 
 class SumOfN{
 
    int sum =0;
	
    int add(int n){
      sum = sum+n;
      n= n-1;	
     if( n > 0 ){// if means its conditional stamt , it will execute the inside code if and only if 
	          // n > 0 else it will not execute 
	   add(n);
	 }
     return sum; 
	  
	}
	public static void main(String giri[]){
	 SumOfN a1 = new  SumOfN();
	 int sumof10 = a1.add(10);
	  System.out.println(sumof10);
	  
	   int sumof100 = a1.add(100);
	  System.out.println(sumof100);
	}
 } 
 
 Note: sum of n number formula : n(n+1)/2 i.e 10(10+1)2 = 10(11)/2 = 110/2 = 55
 
 
 Method Cyclic : method cyclic means it is proces of calling method 1 to method 2 and method 2 to method 1;
  is called as method cyclic, in case method cyclic min 2 methods required but max we can involve n methods.
  
  Example : 
  
     class A{
	 
	    void m1(){
		
		   m2();
		}
		
		void  m2(){
		  m1();
		}
	 }
	 
	 in case of methid cyclic also we will get compilation sucess but at run time we will
	 the Exception in thread "main" java.lang.StackOverflowError.
	  
	  
	  Constructor Recursive:  the process of self invocation from same constructor is called as 
	  constructor recursive. 
	  
	   example : class A{
	          A(){
			    this();// CTE
			  }	       
	     }
		 
	Note: java will not support constructor recursive, why bzc due to construction chaining , we are stoping execution 
	  without reaching Object class no arg constructor. So we will get compilation time error 
	  
	  constructor cyclic: it is a process of calling construction 1 to constructor2 and
	  constructor2 to constructorl is called constructor cyclic. 
	  
	   example : class A{
	          A(){
			    this(10);
			  }	 

			A(int i){
			 this()
			}
	     }
		 
		 Note: java will not support constructor cyclic, why bzc due to construction chaining, 
		 we are stoping execution without reaching Object class no arg constructor. So we will get compilation time error 
	  
	  so final conclusion is java is not supporting for constructor cyclic or recursive. it will support
	   only for method cyclic or recursive. here we will get compilation sucess but runtime we will get 
	    stack over flow error.
