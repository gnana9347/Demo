			classes and Objects:
=================================

class: it is a real time entity,  it is act like catagory.  we can't touch or we cant see the catogies.
real time entity: the thing which is having properties and behaviours is called as real time entity.
class is a blue print of an object..
this real time entity is represent as a class in java .

properties : preoperties are represents as a attributes in java , 
by using properties we can represents state of the object or entity.

behaviours: behaviours of the entity is represents as methods in java.
  by using methods we can achive the activies or functions of entity .

Object : instance of Entity is called as object. object is a real thing for that catagory, 
these objects we can see and we can touch it. but catogies we cant see or we cant touch.
    

in java we can create object by using "new" operator. 

   Syntax : 
         ClassName refVar = new ClassName();
		 
		  Person p1  = new Person(); -> person class object.
		  
		  
		  for example if we take Person is a entity 
		  Entity - Person   -- class 
		  propertis : age, name, hright, weight etc  -- attributes
		  behaviours: getRunRate()  -- methods
		  
		  class Person{
		     int age;  // datatype  attributeName;
			 String name;
			 double height;
			 double weight;
			 
			double getRunRate(){
			    return (height*weight)/age; 
			 }
			 
		  }
		  
		  
		  class PersonManager{
		    public static void main(String args[]){
			Person p1 = new Person();
			  p1.name = "Gnana";
			  p1.age= 23;
			  p1.height = 6.0;
			  p1.weight = 60.0;
			  
			  double gnanaRunRate = p1.getRunRate();
			  
			  System.out.println("Name:"+p1.name); // Name:Gnana  10+20 = 30, "abc"+20 = abc20 "abc"+"xyz" = abcxyz
			  System.out.println("age:"+p1.age);
			  System.out.println("height:"+p1.height);
			  System.out.println("weight:"+p1.weight);
			  System.out.println("RunRate:"+gnanaRunRate);
			  
			   Person p2 = new Person();
			  
			  p2.name = "Mouni";
			  p2.age= 30;
			  p2.height = 5.4;
			  p2.weight = 68.0;
			  
			  double mouniRunRate = p2.getRunRate();
			  
			  System.out.println("Name:"+p2.name); // Name:Gnana  10+20 = 30, "abc"+20 = abc20 "abc"+"xyz" = abcxyz
			  System.out.println("age:"+p2.age);
			  System.out.println("height:"+p2.height);
			  System.out.println("weight:"+p2.weight);
			  System.out.println("RunRate:"+mouniRunRate );
			  
			  
			}
		  }

			 Person p1 -> ref variable 
			
			 
			  new -> operator
			  Person() : contructor 
			  new Person() : object 
			  p1 = ref variable
			  Person -> this object belongs which catagory or what type of object 
			  
			   p2.name = "Mouni";
			     this single .(dot) : access operator : this guy will get the access permission to get class members or object members
				 = (equals operator) this is called assignment operator : this guy will assign rightside value into left side variable
