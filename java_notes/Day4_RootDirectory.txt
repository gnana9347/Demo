 
	   Note: as of  now we are keeping .java files and .class files together inside same src folder. but its not 
	   advisible because in case instead of deleting .class file if we delete .java file we will loose our source code.
	   if we want to develop or write the java code again it will takes more time compare to creating .class file. 
	   
	   even though if .class creating also times more time it is not a burden for us. it is a burden to compiler, 
	   
	   so its better to seperate .java files and .class files. 
	   
	   as per folder name we given as src it means source code so we should keep only .
		
	   java files inside src but for .class files we will create one more new folder wiht the name of "classes". inside classes folder we will keep .class files.
	   
	   but javac cmd by default it will create .class files under current location only i.e src folder where our .java files avaiable . but we dont want to create 
		
	   .class files under src folder, we need to create under classes folder 
	   
	   how to make java compiler to create .class files under user specified location ?
	   
	   by using -d option for javac cmd we can specifie where we need to create .class files by compiler.
	   
	   syntax: javac -d <.class file destination location > .java file name with extention
	   
	   example:  src> javac -d D:\lab\202402_JavaBatch\classes PersonAddress.java
	   
	   -d :   redirect , by using -d we can redirect generated .class files into user specified location.
	   
	   while giving location to .class files we can use the 2 ways to specifie destination location 
	    
		1. absolute path : it is process of specifing the address from starting to ending always with complete address.
		 
		 2. real path or relative path: it is process of specifing destination address from our current location instead of the starting of address. 
			  
			  
			  Note: in order to reach classes folder location from src folder , just 2 steps are enough. 
			   1. one step backward  ( normaly in system we can use back word button or upward button) but from cmd prompt how to go one step back ward? 
				   
				   ans: in cmd propt if we want to go one step back ward we shld use ../ (double dot/)
				   
			   2. one step forward in to classes folder: in normal system means we can just double click on folder name  i.e classes folder. 
			     but from cmd prompt how to go to forward direction?
			     ans: in cmd prompt use /folder name (/classes) we can go forward direction.
				 
				final realpath: ../classes 
				 
				 
				 cd : change directory 
				 ../ : one step back ward / previous location
				 ./ : current location 
				 cls: clear screen
				 mkdir : create folder or directory
				 
				 these are windows cmds not java cmd 
				 
				 
				D:\lab\202401_JavaBatch\src>cd ../

				D:\lab\202401_JavaBatch>cd ../
	
				D:\lab>

				D:\lab\202401_JavaBatch\src>cd ../classes

				D:\lab\202401_JavaBatch\classes>

				D:\lab\202401_JavaBatch\src>javac -d ../classes PersonAddress.java

				D:\lab\202401_JavaBatch\src>javac -d D:/lab/202401_JavaBatch/classes PersonAddress.java

				D:\lab\202401_JavaBatch\src>javac -d ../././classes PersonAddress.java

				D:\lab\202401_JavaBatch\src>javac -d ../../classes PersonAddress.java
				javac: directory not found: ../../classes
				
				Usage: javac <options> <source files>
				use -help for a list of possible options
				
				here : ../../classes folder we are going 2 steps back ward  means we will reach 202401_JavaBatch folder from src then 
				inside 202401_JavaBatch we are looking for classes folder , so its not available under 202401_JavaBatch folder so we are getting 
				above error. 
				
				if we want to run the our .class files we need to change the location from src to classes :
				
				D:\lab\202401_JavaBatch\src> cd ../classes

				D:\lab\202401_JavaBatch\dev\classes>java Address
				I am address

				D:\lab\202401_JavaBatch\dev\classes>java Person
				I am person
				
				D:\lab\202401_JavaBatch\dev\classes>cd ../src

				D:\lab\202401_JavaBatch\src>javac PersonAddress.java

				D:\lab\202401_JavaBatch\src>
				 
				 Note: compilation has to done from src folder 
				       execution has to done from classes folder
