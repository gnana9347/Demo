class members: class is a entity, which is having the properties and behaviours. 
		     class is having mainly 4 members.
			 
   			  1. attributes / variables
			  2. constructors
			  3. methods
			  4. initialization blocks 
			  
			  
			  attributes: properties of the entity are represented as a attributes in side java class.
			  
			  attribute is one of variable type it is called as global variables 
			  
			  variable: variable is small memory space , it can store only one value. if we try to give the new value  then it will replace old 
				values with new value. 
			  
			  syntax : 
			          dataType attributeName / variableName ;
					  
					  here 
					  
					  attributeName or variableName is act as name of our small memory space.
					  dataType specifies which type value we can able to store inside that variable or attribute or that small memory space.
					  
					  ex: int age;
					      double height;
						  
						  here int , double are act as a datatypes.
					  
					  
					  Attributes naming rules:
					  =========================
					  1. attribute name should start lowerCase
					     ext: String name; - correct
						      String Name: -> wrong
						 
					  2. if attairbute is having more than one word, then from second
					      word onwards we should folllow camel case.i.e fro 2nd word
						  onwards every word should start with upper case.
						  
						  ex: String firstName; - correct
						  ex: String placeOfBirth; - correct
						  ex: String dateOfBirth; - correct
						      String firstname: -> wrong
						      String FirstName: -> wrong
							  
					   3. atribute name should not start with numner or any special chars 
					     excpet $ or _(under score). 
					  
					  ex: String _firstName; - correct
						  ex: String $placeOfBirth; - correct
						  ex: String dateOfBirth; - correct
						      String #firstname: -> wrong
						      String @FirstName: -> wrong
							  
							 
					  data types in java: data type will deciede what type of value we cn store in that variable or attribute.
					  
					  in java we have 2 types of datatypes.
					  
					   1. primitive data type
					   2. derived data type
					   
					   primitive data type: all predefind data types are called as primitive data types.
					   
					   in java mainly we have 8 primitive data types   
						 
						 byte  
						 short 
						 int 
						 long
						 float
						 double 
						 boolean -> this data type is used to store conditional values like true or false values. 
						  
						 char -> this data type we will used to store any single char using single quotes.
						  ex : char c = 'a';
						        char c1 = '7';
								charc3 = '#';
						 
						 here these 4 data types 
								 byte  
								 short 
								 int 
								 long   
						are used to store numeric values without decimal points, in this 
						4 data types defult one is int data type.
						  
						 here these 2 data types 
								 float
								 double   
						 are used to store numeric values with decimal points,in this 
						2 data types defult one is double data type.
						
						 if we want to assing values to float data type we should use 'f' char end of the number else we can't give values to float.
						 
						 float f = 10.25f;  // -> correct
						 float f = 10.25;  // -> wrong
						 
						 but for double we can store both the values
						 
						 double d = 10.25f;  // -> correct
						 double d1 = 10.25;  // -> correct
						 
						 
						 special data type: .
						 =================
							String -> this data type we will used to store any alpha numeric values using double quotes.using string we can store multiple chars at a time.
						 
						  ex : String name = "k7it";
						        
						Note: this data type we can use it as both the ways like primitive data types and derived data types so its called special data type
						
						datatype  range      capacity  		 range     	 defaultvalue 
						======================================================================
						byte       1byte     	256		-128 to +127	    0
						short      2byte      65736	 	-32678 to +32767   0
						int        4byte      2power32	 	 		    0
						long       8byte      2power64	 	 		    0
						float      4byte      2power32	 	 		    0.0f
						double     8byte      2power64	 	 		    0.0
						boolean    1byte      256	 	 		    false
						char       2byte      2power16	 	 		    ''or(\u0000)
						String 							    null
						 
						 
						 in able 6 data types from (byte to double) we can store lower data type values into higer capacity data types but we can't store reverse way.
						 
						 int i = 10;
						 float f = i;//its possible
						 
						 shot s =10;
						 int i1 =s;// its possible 
						 
						 but 
						 
						 byte b = s; // not possible 
						 
						 int i2 = f;// not possible
						 
						 
						 Memory mesurments:
						 ===========================
						 unit 				size/capacity
						 ===================================
						 1bit 					binay bit either (0 or 1)
						 8bits					1byte = 2nibble
						 1024bytes				1KB(kilo bytes)
						 1024KBs				1MB(Mega bytes)
						 1024MBs				1GB(Giga bytes)
						 1024GBs				1TB(Tera bytes)
						 1024TBs				1PB(Peta bytes)
						 1024PBs				1EB(Exa bytes)
						 1024EBs				1ZB(Zetta bytes)
						 1024ZBs				1YB(Yotta byte)
						 1024YBs				1BB(Bronto byte)
						 1024BBs				1GeopB(Geop byte)
						 
						 Geop byte is the highest memory.
