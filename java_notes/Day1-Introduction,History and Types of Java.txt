Software: the process of converting our imaginaries into a reality by using set programs is called as software.

software can divided into 3 types mainly 

1. system software : it is software which is used to control the functionality of hardwards like washing machine  softwares, JCB softwares , oven, cars engine , robos , dvd players, flopy disk softwares etc. 

These softwares are called as Stand alone softwares.

scope: sysstem softwares scope is with in the device
   
2. application/Intranet softwareres :  it is also a sofgtwares, which is used to control the functionality of organizational oriented  process those softwares are called application softwares example: hospital management softwares, college management softwares, Bank procees softwares, telephone service with in the building  etc .

these applications also called as intranet application;

scope: intranet softwares scope  is with in the building or organization.


3. internet softwares : the sofwares which are used  thorugh internate from any where in the wold (WWW)  those softwares called as internate applications.  www applications are called as internet applications, these applications also called as wold wise web applications.
	
	 here in this 
	 system softwares :  this softwares are stand alone softwares/ applications
	 application softwares : is called as intranet softwares	 
	 internet softwares : this distributed softwares / applications 
	 
	 scope: internet softwares scope  is entire world.


	 types of applications: 
	     1. stand alone applications:

		    the softwares where we have  installed in that system only we can able to use that softwares,  those  softwares are called as standalone applications.
		   like VLC players, MS Office , antivirus software, OS, 
			
		   this type of softwares we can't share with others i.e these are not sharable applications
						 			   
			all system softwares and application softwares will comes under standalone applications. 
  			
		 2. distributed applications: all internate applications are called as a distributed applications .
		   these softwares we can access from any where thorugh internate(www). like gmail, yahoo, facebook,  youtube, twitter etc applications are called internate applications. 
		   these applications are sharable applications. 
		   
		  
		  if we want to develop any of these applications we need the progrmaing languages like C, C++, java, .net, python , angular. 
		  
		  in these programing languages java has the huge demand in the market: so we are going to learn java programming language . 
		  
		  
		  Lets start Java: 
		  
		  introduction about java:
		  =========================
		  
		  -> java is a object oriented programing language(oops), it means in java everything we can achive in the form of classes and Objects formates only.
		  
		  -> java is open source software : open source means its a free of cost. we no need to pay even single ruppe for using java software for developing our projects. because of this java getting  huge market in the software world. 
		  
		  -> java is platform independent software :  write once run anywhere is called platform independent language. 
		  write the program in one operationg system same program we can execute or run in any  
			  other operating is called platform independent programs. 
			  
		  -> java is highly secure language.

			  old:
              SCJP :  Sun certificated java programmer
              SCWCD:  sun certificated web component developer
              SCECD 	
              now: 			  
              OCJP :  Oracle certificated java programmer
			  OCWCD : oracle certificated web component developer
			  
			  
				
					Types of java:
					=============
					
					1.J2SE : Java 2 standard edition : by using J2SE we can develop stand alone applications 
						   like mobile games, video games , anti virus, vlc players.
						   (.jar)  java Archive files
						   the budle of set of java programs are called jar file
						   or (.exe)  -> executable files
													   
					2.J2ME : Java 2 Micro edition / Mobile Edition : by using J2ME we can develop mobile applications
					                                       even android applications are developed by Java only.
															.apk
					3.J2EE : Java 2 EnterPrize Edition: by using J2EE we can develop EJB applications like large scale applications i.e warehouse managemnts or bank applications etc where we need highly secure and very big appications we can go for J2EE. 
					 like Web appplication (.war) or EnterPrize applications(.ear) (.war)
					
 					 jar -> java archive   -> .java files  -> to run we need  cmd prompt
					 
					 war -> web archive  -> .java files + web.xml (Web container) ->  to run we need  web server(Tomcat) + browser
					 
					 ear -> enterprize archive -> .java files +  web.xml (web container)+ applicalication container -> to run we need application server(Web logic, webshpere,jboss) + browser
					 
					 apk -> android package								 
														 
					  we want to become web application developer so we can learn only J2SE and J2EE.
					  
					  if we want to become mobile developer then we need to learn j2se and j2me.
